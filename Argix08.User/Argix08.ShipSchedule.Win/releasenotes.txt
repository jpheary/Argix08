INSTALLATION
==============
DEPLOYMENT
Ship Schedule is installed into a deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ShipSchedule on a web server like RGXDEVDB using 
	Windows explorer.
2.	Copy the following files into this folder-
		Argix08.AppLogging.dll
		Argix08.Configuration.dll
		Argix08.Data.dll
		Argix08.Export.dll
		Argix08.ShipSchedule.Lib.dll
		Argix08.Windows.dll
		ExportDS.xsd
		Infragistics2.Shared.v10.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.UltraWinGrid.v10.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.v10.1.dll
		Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.dll
		ShipSchedule.exe
		ShipSchedule.exe.config
3.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.


CONFIGURATION	
Open the local sort database (i.e. TSORTLOCAL on RGXDEVDB), goto the Configuration table, and add/edit the 
values below:
	Application     PCName          Key                       Value                     Security 
	--------------- --------------- ------------------------- ------------------------- -------- 
	Ship Schedule   jheary          Role                      LineHaulAdministrator     1        
	Ship Schedule   tpjheary        Role                      LineHaulCoordinator       1        


NOTES

GENERAL
The Ship Schedule Application (ShipSchedule.exe) is a Windows based application used to manage
outbound ship schedules. The application provides the following services:
LineHaulOperator

- print and export any ship schedule
LineHaulCoordinator
- all features of LineHaulOperator

- send ship schedules reports to agents and carriers

OPERATION
Normal:
The Ship Schedule Application (ShipSchedule.exe) operates by launching from a web server deployment url 
(i.e. http://rgxdevdb/ShipSchedule/ShipSchedule.application). After a brief splash screen, a sizeable window appears and 
displays a split window. The taskbar displays the operating terminal and connection status. 
Additional operating steps can be found in the on-line documentation provided by the Help/Contents menu item.

Diagnostics Mode:
CTL ENTER at the Splash screen displays a dialog that examines configuration and database requirements.
