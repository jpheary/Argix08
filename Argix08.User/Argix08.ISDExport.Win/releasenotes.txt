INSTALLATION
==============
DEPLOYMENT
ISD Export is installed into a deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ISDExport on a web server using Windows explorer.
2.	Copy the following files into this folder:
		Argix08.AppLogging.dll
		Argix08.Configuration.dll
		Argix08.Data.dll
		Argix08.Windows.dll
		Infragistics2.Shared.v10.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.UltraWinGrid.v10.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.v10.1.dll
		ISDExport.exe
		ISDExport.exe.config
3.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.


CONFIGURATION

NOTES
==============
GENERAL
The ISD Export Application (ISDExport.exe) is a Windows based application used to export sorted item 
records into a text file suitable for import into the Bearware RDS system.


OPERATION
Normal:
The ISD Export Application (ISDExport.exe) operates by launching from a web server deployment url 
(i.e. http://localhost/Argix08/Apps/ISDExport/ISDExport.application). After a brief splash screen, a 
sizeable window appears and displays a split window with a Pickups grid on top and a Sorted Items grid 
on bottom. The Pickups grid shows pickups for the selected day for ISD clients. Select a pickup to 
display the cartons sorted for that pickup in the Sorted Items grid. If there are sorted cartons for 
the selected pickup, use the File/Export menu item to export the sorted items to a text file. The 
taskbar displays the operating terminal and connection status. Additional operating steps can be found 
in the on-line documentation provided by the Help/Contents menu item.
