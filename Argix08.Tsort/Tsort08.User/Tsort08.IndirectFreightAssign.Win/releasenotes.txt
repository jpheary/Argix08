INSTALLATION
==============
DEPLOYMENT
Indirect Freight Assignment is installed into a deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\IndirectFreightAssign on a web server like RGXDEV using 
	Windows explorer.
2.	Copy the following files into this folder-
		Argix08.AppLogging.dll
		Argix08.Configuration.dll
		Argix08.Data.dll
		Argix08.Windows.dll
		IndirectFreightAssign.exe
		IndirectFreightAssign.exe.config
		Infragistics2.Shared.v10.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.UltraWinGrid.v10.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.v10.1.dll
3.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.


CONFIGURATION	
Open the local sort database (i.e. TSORT on JARGXTS), goto the Configuration table, and add/edit the 
values below:
	Application                 PCName          Key                     Value                     Security

NOTES
==============
GENERAL
The Indirect Freight Assignment Application (IndirectFreightAssign.exe) is a Windows based application used to 
manage station assignments for sorting indirect freight.


OPERATION
Normal:
The Indirect Freight Assignment Application (IndirectFreightAssign.exe) operates by launching from a web server deployment 
url (i.e. http://rgxvmweb/Argix08/Apps/IndirectFreightAssign/IndirectFreightAssign.application). After a brief splash screen, a sizeable window 
appears and displays imported trips in an upper grid and station sort assignments in a lower grid. The user can import 
trips from a pre-defined location or from a user defined location. The user can assign and unassign these trips from sort 
stations in the operating terminal. The taskbar displays the operating terminal and sort station. Additional operating steps 
can be found in the on-line documentation provided by the Help/Contents menu item.
