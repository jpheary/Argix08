INSTALLATION
==============
DEPLOYMENT
Freight Assignment is installed into a deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\FreightAssign on a web server like RGXWEB using 
	Windows explorer.
2.	Copy the following files into this folder-
		Argix08.AppLogging.dll
		Argix08.Configuration.dll
		Argix08.Data.dll
		Argix08.Windows.dll
		FreightAssignment.exe
		FreightAssignment.exe.config
		Infragistics2.Shared.v10.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.UltraWinGrid.v10.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.v10.1.dll
3.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.


CONFIGURATION
Open the local sort database (i.e. TSORTLOCAL on RGXDEVDB), goto the Configuration table, and add/edit the 
values below:
	Application               PCName          Key                       Value                     Security

NOTES
==============
GENERAL
The Freight Assignment Application (FreightAssign.exe) is a Windows based application used to 
manage station assignments for sorting direct freight.


OPERATION
Normal:
The Freight Assignment Application (FreightAssign.exe) operates by launching from a web server deployment 
url (i.e. http://rgxdev/FreightAssign/FreightAssign.exe). After a brief splash screen, a sizeable window 
appears and displays inbound freight in an upper grid and station sort assignments in a lower grid. The 
user can assign and unassign these shipments from sort stations in the operating terminal. The taskbar 
displays the operating terminal and sort station. Additional operating steps can be found in the on-line 
documentation provided by the Help/Contents menu item.
